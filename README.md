COVID-19 College Quarantine/Isolation Tracking App
We're creating an app to anonymously connect quarantined, isolated, curious, and cautious college students to increase the spread of COVID-19 information for young adults. Our goal is to improve mental health of young adults, take advantage of the widespread # of college cases (by analyzing this data), and streamline the isolation/quarantine process for students and colleges.

All answers are FULLY anonymous!
